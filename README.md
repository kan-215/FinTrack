# FinTrack
This is my ALX SE foundations Final project. It is a web application that i designed with the sole purpose of helping users to manage and track all their finances. This is achieved by allowing them to add, edit, and delete their daily transactions as well as have a monthly overview of their expenses and incomes in form of charts
